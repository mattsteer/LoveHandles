#LoveHandles 

Author: @mattsteer - matt@shadesecurity.com

LoveHandles was inspired by Sektor7 training and @BillDemirkapi's talk a few years back. 

A small application that searches for privileged handles in unprivileged processes. This has found me exactly 0 CVE's may it bring you more luck!

Run the application, look for output.
